# Objective
The goal of this project is to develop and deploy an ML model in which an end user can specify a set of features describing a commercial flight of interest and receive a categorical (yes or no) output indicating if that flight will be delayed more than fifteen minutes or not.

# Core Values
This project is a collaborative effort of people from different backgrounds in data science coming together to build cool projects. The goal of this effort is to foster **collaboration**, have people **learn** new and interesting concepts, and build a project which is **usable** by a wider audience other than just the team members.

The goal is not to simply focusing on building the most complex and advanced model, but to make a working project/product to help collaborators get exposed to the entire lifecycle of a data science project and have them work as a team and learn new skills.
